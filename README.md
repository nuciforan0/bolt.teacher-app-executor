# bolt teacher app executor 

This is how to run the applications which are made by the bolt.teacher application to test if it works in a proper LMS simulator (and hence if it could be deployed to blackboard and other popular educational platforms with LTI 1.0 compliance)

# Running bolt teacher apps
1. Install the application that was made in bolt.teacher (PUT PICTURE HERE SHOWING HOW TO DO THIS)
2. cd into the directory and npm install ( DOUBLE CHECK )
3. git clone this repo.
4. navigate to the lti-bouncer directory and type
```bash
pnpm start
```
5. go the lti 1.0 simulator file and open the launchurl.html in your browser of choice.
6. It should work :)
